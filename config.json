/*
  Flavorpush
  Sample Configuration file

  This configuration file should reside in the local directory to the Flavorpush application.  It consists of an unnamed
  array of objects defining each product flavor that your app supports.

  The fields for each product flavor are:

  name - A key to uniquely identify each product flavor.
  applicationName - Your application name.  Per Google, this should follow the MyCompany-Application/1.0 format.
  packageName - The package name for the product flavor.
  serviceAccountEmail - The service acccount email address configured for your developer account.  (NOTE: Flavorpush
  does not support Installed application authentication at this time.)
  keyFile - The path to your service account key file.  You can use just the file name if it is in the local directory.

  Remove this comment before running Flavorpush as JSON standard does not support comments.
